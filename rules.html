                <h2>&bullet;Snooker rules</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="snookerrules">
                <div id="note">
                    <p class="note">Snooker rules are very complicated because when you play, you will encounter so many
                        different situations. But don't worry, let me introduce very basic snooker rules and these rules
                        can help you
                        understand most time of a snooker game.
                    </p><br>
                </div>

                <div id="basicsnookerrules">
                    <p>Players take it in turns to break (start the frame) with a coin toss deciding who starts the
                        first frame. The break is made with the cue-ball in the D and a red must be struck.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Scoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        If either palyer grasps a chance and pots the first red successfully,
                        which is worth 1 point, then the player can continue to play any other colored balls:
                        <span style="color: rgb(211, 211, 0);">Yellow</span> (2 points),
                        <span style="color: green;">Green</span> (3 points),
                        <span style="color: brown;">Brown</span> (4 points),
                        <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> (5 points),
                        <span style="color: pink;">Pink</span> (6 points)
                        and Black (7 points). After potting the colored ball, the referee will re-spot the colored ball
                        (the reds are not re-spotted) and the player reverts to a red and alternates red, then color
                        until all the reds are potted. The remaining six colours are then potted in ascending points
                        order, thus finishing with the black.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Winning</h3>
                    <p>
                        The winner is the person who scores the most points in a frame. Once a player has a lead of more
                        points than remain on the table the opponent is said to “need snookers”. A snooker is where the
                        balls are so placed so that the player cannot directly hit the next legal ball. The hope is to
                        force a foul and earn four points. If a player thinks they cannot win, even by forcing snookers,
                        they concede the frame, usually when around four or more snookers (fouls) would be required in
                        addition to all the remaining balls, depending on how many balls are left.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="note">
                        If you understand the rules above, you will not get confused when you see the match in most
                        cases.
