                    <p class="note">
                        Current professional snooker world, there are serveral elite players who dominate snooker champions.
                        These players are ranked world top 10 all the years. They are unbeatable for some players.
                        Each one has different potting styles. Some are good at defending while some have high potting success so they can play more aggressively.
                        The difference between these players and others is that their snooker skills are very comprehensive. 
                        Those who are good at defending doesn't mean they would lose the pots that they think should have potted in.
                        Also, they have very steady state of mind, they know the winning mentality. That's why they can stand in the stage of world top 10.
                        Let me introduce several of them. Any snooker fan is familiar with them.

                                He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with "snooker emperor" Stephen Hendry.
                                He is the only player to have reached 1,000 century breaks.
                                He plays snooker so fast that the referee needs to hurry to respot the colored balls.
                                So the fans give him the nickname "The Rocket".
                                He finished 147 maximun break at the 1997 World Championship in just 5 minutes and 8 seconds.
                                He has stunning 15 times 147 maximun break in professional competition, the highest among players.
                                It's a great pleasure to watch him play snooker. You would get a thinking that snooker is very easy.
