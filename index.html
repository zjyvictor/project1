            </div>

            <div id="note">
                <p class="note">It has been over 140 years since the sport was invented. Now it is very popular in the
                    UK, China, Thailand and other countries.
                    At the 2019 World Championship, the best players on the planet competed for a top prize of <span
                        style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">£500,000</span>
                    and the total prize pool was over <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">£2 million</span>,
                    watched by <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">half a billion</span> people around the
                    globe.
                    It's hard to imagine how Snooker deveploed from nothing.</p><br>

                    <h3>&nbsp;India, the birthplace</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Now most of professional snooker opens or championships take place in the UK. You might think snooker
                    is orignated from the UK.
                    Acutually, you are wrong. The game of snooker was invented in 1875 by the British Army in the Indian
                    town of Jubbulpore.
                    So, India is the real birthplace of snooker. It is recorded that young lieutenant
                    Neville Chamberlain was experimenting on the officers’ mess table with the existing game of ‘Black
                    Pool’ featuring 15 red balls and a black.

                    <h3>&nbsp;Snooker, a slang term for rookie</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Having thrown on additional coloured balls and heard that rookie cadets at the Royal Military Academy
                    at Woolwich were called ‘snookers’, Chamberlain observed that all those present were snookers at
                    this tweaked version of the game, and the name instantly stuck.</p><br>

                <p>Afterwards, the game spread to other Indian colonies and the UK. After decades of development,
                    it has become one of the most attractive sports games.
                    Now it is governed by the

                    Have you noticed that on his waistcoats, there is a crown that I circled?
                    You might think it is a merchant logo just like the bottom.
                    Actually, it represents an honor.
                    That means he has won all the three most prestigious tournaments in snooker:
                    the <span style="color: blueviolet; font-weight: 600;">World Championship</span> ,
                    the <span style="color: blueviolet; font-weight: 600;">UK Championship</span>,

                    These three events together make up the

                                UK Championship is the second-biggest ranking tournament, after the World Championship.
                                It has been staged at the Barbican Center, York, England since 2011. 
                                It's also very tough to win. 
                                The winner needs to continuely win from first round to fourth round, 
                                then quarter-final, semi-final. All these matches are 11 frames and
                                the winner needs to win 10 out of 19 frames in the final.
                                Last year the total prize money was over £1 million and the winner received £200,000.
