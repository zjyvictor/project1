                        The History of Snooker
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        It is over 140 years since a young officer in the British Army, experimenting on a billiard
                        table, came up with the game we now know as snooker. At the 2019 World Championship the best
                        players on the planet will be competing for a top prize of £500,000, watched by half a billion
                        people around the globe. Two of snooker’s leading journalists, Hector Nunns and David Hendon,
                        plot snooker’s course from small beginnings to a major international sport…

                    <p class="subtitle">
                        The beginning
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        In the 19th century, billiards was a popular pastime among the British Armed Forces stationed in
                        India. Two of the most popular games were black pool and pyramid pool. Black pool is a gambling
                        game which involved as many coloured balls as there were players along with a black ball. Each
                        player owned a coloured ball which serves as his cue ball but is an object ball to the others.
                        If it is potted he must pay the striker who is then allowed to pot the black ball. If he
                        succeeded, all opponents must pay him. A good player will alternate potting a coloured ball and
                        the black ball to maximize winnings. Balls are respotted after being sunk. In pyramid pool,
                        there were 15 red balls and a white cue ball, and each player received one point per red ball
                        potted.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        In 1875, at the British Army Officer's Mess in Jubbulpore (now Jabalpur), Central Provinces,
                        Colonel Sir Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain suggested combining the two games. The new
                        game was beginning to resemble snooker in its current form, though the blue and brown balls were
                        added in later years.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        The name snooker comes from a comment Chamberlain made about a player who missed a shot. He
                        called him "a real snooker", referring to his lack of experience, "snooker" being a slang term
                        for a first year cadet. The first official set of rules for snooker were drafted in 1882 at
                        Ootacamund in Madras Province. When British Billiards Champion John Roberts travelled to India
                        in 1885, he met Chamberlain and decided to introduce snooker to England when he returned home.

                                The first official competitions, the English Amateur Championships, took place in 1916.
                                In 1927,
                                Joe Davis helped to establish the first Professional World Championship of snooker. Joe
                                Davis
                                won and took home the prize of six pounds and ten shillings. At that time, the standard
                                of play
                                was not very high considering that the highest break of that tournament was just 60. By
                                the
                                1930s, Snooker was becoming one of the most popular cue sports.

                                Joe Davis continued to dominate the era, winning every World Championship until his
                                retirement
                                in 1946. Between 1952 and 1957, a dispute had arisen among the games' governing body,
                                the
                                Control Council, and the Billiards Association. As a result, only two people
                                participated in the
                                official 1952 World Championship. Due to a decline in popularity, there were no world
                                championships between 1958 and 1963.

                        Rise in popularity
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        In 1969, the BBC launched the Pot Black tournament at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, which
                        proved to be very successful in helping put snooker back into public view. The BBC began
                        broadcasting in colour and were looking for programmes that could exploit this new technology.
                        The programme first aired on 23 July 1969, on BBC2. Pot Black was a British series of
                        (non-ranking) snooker tournaments televised by BBC which played a large part in the
                        popularisation of the modern game. In 1972, a twenty-three year old Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins
                        clinched the first of his two World Titles and through a mixture of bravado, charisma and an
                        ability to make headlines helped to popularise the sport in the new age of colour television.
                        The event continued until 1986, returned in 1990, but was discontinued after the 1993 event.

                    <p>
                        Pot Black was revived in the form of several one-off tournaments throughout the 1990s and up to
                        2007. Pot Black helped transform snooker from a minority sport with just a handful of
                        professionals into one of the most popular sports in the United Kingdom. Mark Williams holds the
                        events' highest break record of 119. The World Championship was first televised in 1973. World
                        rankings were introduced in 1976, and, in 1977, the World Championship was held in the Crucible
                        Theatre in Sheffield, where it has been ever since. Daily television coverage of the World
                        Championship began in 1978.

                        The 1980s capitalised on the sport's already growing popularity. &nbsp;&nbsp;
